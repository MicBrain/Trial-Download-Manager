# Trial Download Manager

### What is Download Manager?

  "Download Manager" is a functional software application that allows users to play with three various choices for requesting files from the server. Those choices are without any fancy attributes, using HTTP/1.1 technology and using HTTP/2 technology. This package is an experimental collection of C++ and C programs that helps us to test the speed of downloading various files using HTTP connection. This is part of "GSoC CernVM-FS" project.

### Software Requirements

  Currently this software is guaranteed to run perfectly on Ubuntu OS. During the development of this project, the official version of libcurl that supports HTTP/2 was not from the git repo: https://github.com/bagder/curl.
