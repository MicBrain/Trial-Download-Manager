### What is Download Manager?

"Download Manager" is a functional software application that allows users to play with three various choices for requesting files from the server. Those choices are without any fancy attributes, using HTTP/1.1 technology and using HTTP/2 technology. This package is an experimental collection of C++ and C programs that helps us to test the speed of downloading various files using HTTP connection. This is part of "GSoC CernVM-FS" project.
